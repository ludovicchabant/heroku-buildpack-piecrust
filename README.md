Apache+PHP+PieCrust build pack
========================

This is a build pack bundling PHP and Apache for Heroku apps, along with baking
or bootstraping a [PieCrust][] website if it is found.

Information
-----------

This is a slightly modified fork of the [Apache+PHP build pack][1] from Heroku.
It just adds a script that downloads the latest version of PieCrust, and bakes
the site if any is found.

For more information about the rest of the process, go see the [original build
pack][1].
